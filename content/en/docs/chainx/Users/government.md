### 2.1 Democratic Rights

At this stage, democratic rights are mainly reflected in citizen proposals and referendums. Citizen Proposal is that each citizen can propose any specific proposal, which takes the form of privileged function calls at runtime (including the most powerful call: set_code, which switches out the entire code at runtime to achieve what would otherwise be required" hard fork"). In each fixed period, the motion with the most second votes during that period will be selected and entered into a referendum. Referendums also have a fixed time period for voting to occur, then votes are counted, and if the vote is approved, various transaction calls are made. The referendum is a simple, inclusive, and mortgage-based voting scheme, which mainly affects the weight of the vote according to the different lock-in duration and lock-up amount. All bills passed by the referendum have an implementation delay associated with them, which is the time period between when the referendum is passed and when the changes are implemented.
Note: In the later stage, we will form a proposal forum similar to polkassembly. Citizens can put forward text proposals in the forum. After reaching the approval of the majority of people, they can initiate on-chain proposals in the form of submitting privileged function calls.
