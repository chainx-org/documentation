{{% pageinfo %}}
This page is about running a validator node in ChainX network.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Hardware requirements

The most common way for a beginner to run a validator is on a cloud server running Linux. You may choose whatever VPS provider that you prefer. Ubuntu 18.04+ is recommended.

- OS: Ubuntu 18.04+
- CPU: 4+ Core
- Memory: 4+ GB
- Storage: SSD 300+ GB
- Bandwidth: 10+ M

## Install the `chainx` binary

### Build from source

First, you need to install Rust on your system:

```bash
$ rustup install nightly-2020-09-30
$ rustup override set nightly-2020-09-30
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly-2020-09-30
```

Fetch the source code from GitHub and compile it locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/chainx-org/ChainX
$ cd ChainX
# Switch to the latest tag
$ git checkout $(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))
# Compile the binary in release
$ cargo build --release
```

The binary is under `/target/release`.

### Download the prebuilt binary

You can also directly download from the prebuilt binary from [GitHub release(https://github.com/chainx-org/ChainX/releases)](https://github.com/chainx-org/ChainX/releases).

## Synchronize Chain Data

Run the command below to synchronize chain data.

```bash
$ ./chainx --chain=mainnet --pruning=archive
```

When completed, you need to restart the node with the validator flag.

```bash
$ ./chainx --chain=mainnet --validator
```

Or you can run the above command directly because the validator node will run with `archive` by default.
IMPORTANT! You should wait for node syncing completely and set the session key correctly before you as a candidate.

{{%alert%}}If the error occurred when node syncing, you need to check if the system time consists of the internet time and remove the full database before you try again.{{%/alert%}}

## Configuration

The recommended config for validator node:

```json
{
  "log-dir": "./log", // log directory
  "enable-console-log": false, // disable print log to stdout
  "no-mdns": true,
  "validator": true, // For validator node, it must be set to 'true'.
  "ws-external": false, // ws port is only enabled on localhost
  "rpc-external": false, // rpc port is only enabled on localhost
  "log": "info,runtime=info",
  "port": 20222, // port that p2p uses
  "ws-port": 8087, // ws port
  "rpc-port": 8086, // http port
  "pruning": "archive", // Must be 'archive' for validator node.
  "execution": "NativeElseWasm",
  "db-cache": 2048, // database cache size in MB
  "state-cache-size": 2147483648, // state cache size in B
  "name": "Your-Node-Name", // The display name in telemetry
  "base-path": "data", // path to database, in linux `$HOME/.local/share/chainx/chains/$CHAIN_TYPE/db` by default.
  "bootnodes": [] // bootnodes' url, left empty to use built-in bootnodes.
}
```

{{%alert color="warning"%}} Some RPC is dangerous for validator node. If you want to expose, please use a proxy server to filter. Visit [https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/wiki/Public-RPC](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/wiki/Public-RPC) for details. If you are aware of and understand the potential risks, you can enable it by add `--rpc-method unsafe` to starting arguments.{{%/alert%}}

{{%alert%}} When you node is setup correctly, you can see it at [ChainX Telemetry](https://telemetry.chainx.org) or [Polkadot Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/ChainX). {{%/alert%}}

## Use docker

Copy the above configuration to `config.json` and put it in the current directory.

```bash
$cat ./config.json
{
  "log-dir": "/log",
  "enable-console-log": false,
  "no-mdns": true,
  "validator": true,
  "ws-external": false,
  "rpc-external": false,
  "log": "info,runtime=info",
  "port": 20222,
  "ws-port": 8087,
  "rpc-port": 8086,
  "pruning": "archive",
  "execution": "NativeElseWasm",
  "db-cache": 2048,
  "state-cache-size": 2147483648,
  "name": "Your-Node-Name",
  "base-path": "/data",
  "bootnodes": []
}
```

{{%alert%}} You may want to change `name` field to something else you want to display in telemetry{{%/alert%}}

Run the command below to start a validator node in the background.

```bash
docker run -d --restart always --name chainx -p 8086:8086 -p 8087:8087 -p 20222:20222 -v $PWD/config.json:/config.json -v $PWD/data:/data -v $PWD/log:/log -v $PWD/keystore:/keystore chainxorg/chainx:v2.0.9 /usr/local/bin/chainx --config /config.json
```

You can fetch the log by

```bash
$ tail -f log/chainx.log
```

If some text like the below occurs in your log file, it means that your node starts successfully.

```text
......

```

### Register

You can register in [Our wallet app](https://dapps.chainx.org). Make sure your account has some PCXs for further use.

## Register node

After you register an account, you can register node at [`Network>Staking`](https://dapps.chainx.org/#/staking)
![register-node](/images/register-node.png)

{{%alert%}}Each account can only register once. And before that, you should make sure enough balance for the transaction fee. A newly registered node is nominated by default. You can bond more pcx for your node.{{%/alert%}}

![rebond](/images/bond.png)

## Set Session Keys

Generate session key in the host where you run the node:

```bash
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:$YOUR_RPC_PORT
```

{{%alert%}}`YOUR_RPC_PORT` is the port you specify with `rpc-port`(Default is 8086).{{%/alert%}}

You'll get something like this:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "0x42a7d53603bac173eb96e4ac133e35bcd4a49f308387a0e748b6f6a6dbf5635313f065a67a42a78a2c3e261a63523d92d4e03f9e7c9bba7c3d13b13b6983f0724c46b00699362a374f3fe43dd668eae6fcd815d0b84f88998ca5fc1c41e09b2412e2b9d3a322d9229a24cbce31d53358edc77b6fbaca7d038247743f40b6f205",
  "id": 1
}
```

The `result` field is the generated session keys. Then go to [`Developer>Extrinsic`](https://dapp-v2.chainx.org/#/extrinsics) page, and set it by calling extrinsic.

![setKeys](/images/setkeys.png)

{{%alert%}} Enter `0x00` for `proof` field {{%/alert%}}

Call `nextKey` for validating your config.

## Backup node

You'll be punished while your node is run incorrectly. So it's necessary to deploy an extra node for backup. The backup node should run with `--pruning=archive` flag. When the main node went wrong, you can quickly switch to the backup node to avoid punishment.

## Test your validator

If you are a validator, you may want to check that your node is running correctly. Just cat the log file, your node is all ok if you see `Prepared block for proposing at ...` occurred.

```text

```

## Notes

- Before the first time goes half, each session will take about 5 minutes and mint 50 pcx.
- Each term is last for 12 sessions for re-election.
- Node will be dropout if self-bond is less than 1pcx or total is less than 10 pcx.

## Punishment

ChainX distributes reward at the end of each session and at the same time punishes each evil node. The types of punishment generally include double-signature and node offline. Once a node is found to be evil, all the reward the node deserves in the session will be punished to the treasury, and the node reward pool will be punished according to the evil coefficient recorded on the chain.

```text
penalty = max(session_reward + reward_pot_balance * F, minimum_penalty)
```

- `penalty`: amount of punishment
- `session_reward`: reward the node deserves in this session
- `reward_pot_balance`: amount of the node's reward pool
- `F`: evil coefficient, calculated by `babe` and `im-online`
  - babe: [double signature punishment](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking/#babe-equivocation), [frame/babe/src/equivocation.rs](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/c60f00840034017d4b7e6d20bd4fcf9a3f5b529a/frame/babe/src/equivocation.rs#L265).
  - im-online: [node offline punishment](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking/#unresponsiveness), [frame/im-online/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/c60f00840034017d4b7e6d20bd4fcf9a3f5b529a/frame/im-online/src/lib.rs#L771).
- `minimum_penalty`: lower bound of punishment
